Hypothesis: Intersecting identities, specifically combinations of race, gender, and socioeconomic status, significantly influence an individual’s or group’s vulnerability to food insecurity and economic instability. It is anticipated that marginalized groups—such as women of color from lower socioeconomic backgrounds—will experience higher rates of food insecurity and economic hardship compared to their counterparts from higher socioeconomic statuses or with more socially privileged identities (e.g., male, white). This hypothesis is based on the premise that intersectionality compounds vulnerability, where each additional marginal identity amplifies the risk of experiencing economic difficulties and limited access to food resources.”
